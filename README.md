# What I have learned
Throughout this project I have learned numerous skills regarding CAD and PCB design. I have troubleshooted many problems involving issues with importing PCB designs. I hope to use these skills to make more projects in the future.

# Purpose
I hope to program custom scripts for each of the keys on this microcontroller.

# BOM:
- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 2x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 4x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x M3 Heatset
